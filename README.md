# PHP-SSO

This repository contains the LDAP example to retrieve the SSO Payload information with the help of the UQ SSO PHP library.

The `index.php` is the example that is displayed on https://sentinel-002.uqcloud.net/ldap.

If you want to incorporate to your own application, you will need to use the functions located in `uqsso/auth.php`.

You will need to use the UQ infrastructure zone to test this.
